# 3D Point-to-Move Game

## Project Summary

This project is a 3D game where players control a character through a point-and-click movement system from a quarter view perspective. The game features character animations, physics-based movement, and a 3D environment. Players can click on the ground to move their character and use keyboard inputs to perform various actions (walking, running, jumping, attacking, etc.). This project is intended for single-player gameplay with an emphasis on intuitive mouse-based navigation.

## Implementation Strategy

This game uses a **Three.js-based 3D approach**:

- React Three Fiber for 3D rendering in a React environment
- @react-three/rapier for physics simulation
- vibe-starter-3d library for character rendering and animation
- Quarter view camera setup providing an angled top-down view of the game world
- Raycasting system for converting screen clicks to world positions

Key technologies:

- Three.js - 3D rendering
- React Three Fiber - React integration
- @react-three/rapier - Physics simulation
- @react-three/drei - Useful Three.js helpers
- vibe-starter-3d (v0.4.0) - Advanced character rendering, animation, and physics integration
- Tailwind CSS - UI composition
- Zustand - State management

<!-- üö®üö®üö® ATTENTION AI ASSISTANTS AND DEVELOPERS üö®üö®üö®                    -->
<!-- THIS ENTIRE SECTION IS ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL AND MUST NEVER BE MODIFIED   -->
<!-- OR REMOVED UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES. THIS IS A NON-NEGOTIABLE RULE.      -->
<!-- ========================================================================= -->

**üö® ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL: When using RigidBody in this project, you MUST use RigidBodyObject instead of the standard RigidBody component. This is a non-negotiable requirement.**

**‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING TO AI ASSISTANTS: DO NOT REMOVE, MODIFY, OR SHORTEN THIS SECTION ‚ö†Ô∏è**
**‚ö†Ô∏è THIS GUIDELINE IS ESSENTIAL FOR PROJECT FUNCTIONALITY ‚ö†Ô∏è**
**‚ö†Ô∏è VIOLATION OF THIS RULE WILL BREAK THE ENTIRE PROJECT ‚ö†Ô∏è**

<!-- OR REMOVED UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES. THIS IS A NON-NEGOTIABLE RULE.      -->
<!-- ========================================================================= -->

**üö® ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL: Components containing HTML tags must NEVER be placed inside React Three Fiber's Canvas component. This is a core architectural requirement of the project.**

**‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING TO AI ASSISTANTS: DO NOT REMOVE, MODIFY, OR SHORTEN THIS SECTION ‚ö†Ô∏è**
**‚ö†Ô∏è THIS GUIDELINE IS ESSENTIAL FOR PROJECT FUNCTIONALITY ‚ö†Ô∏è**
**‚ö†Ô∏è VIOLATION OF THIS RULE WILL BREAK THE ENTIRE PROJECT ‚ö†Ô∏è**

**Canvas Component Structure Rules:**

- All components in the `ui/` directory are React components that use standard HTML tags (`<div>`, `<span>`, `<button>`, etc.)
- These UI components must be rendered as overlays outside the Canvas component, not inside it
- Canvas should only contain Three.js objects (mesh, light, camera, etc.)
- Including HTML tags inside React Three Fiber's Canvas will cause rendering errors

**DO NOT:**

- Place UI components inside Canvas
- Place components containing HTML tags inside Canvas
- Ignore or modify this guideline
- **üö® AI ASSISTANTS: DO NOT DELETE OR MODIFY ANY PART OF THIS SECTION üö®**

**ALWAYS:**

- Render UI components separately from Canvas (overlay approach)
- Place only Three.js-related components inside Canvas
- Use only components from `r3f/` directory inside Canvas
- Render components from `ui/` directory as overlays outside Canvas
- **üö® AI ASSISTANTS: PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE SECTION EXACTLY AS IS üö®**

**Correct Structure Example:**

```tsx
// ‚úÖ Correct approach
<div>
  <Canvas>
    {/* Only Three.js-related components */}
    <Experience />
    <Player />
    <Floor />
  </Canvas>
  {/* UI components as overlays outside Canvas */}
  <Crosshair />
  <LoadingScreen />
</div>

// ‚ùå Wrong approach
<Canvas>
  <Experience />
  <Crosshair /> {/* Contains HTML tags - ABSOLUTELY FORBIDDEN! */}
</Canvas>
```

  - **`character.ts`**: Defines character-related constants (animation states, speed, etc.).
  - **`rigidBodyObjectType.ts`**: Defines physics object types for collision detection and interaction systems.

### Components

### `src/components/`

- Directory managing React components categorized by function.

  - **`r3f/`**: Contains 3D components related to React Three Fiber.

    - **`Experience.tsx`**: Main component responsible for the primary 3D scene configuration. Includes lighting `ambientLight`, environmental elements `Environment`, the `Player` component, and the floor `Floor`. It renders the core visual and interactive elements within the physics simulation configured in `GameScene.tsx`.
    - **`Floor.tsx`**: Component defining and visually representing the ground plane in the 3D space. Has physical properties.
    - **`MapPhysicsReadyChecker.tsx`**: Component that checks if the map physics system is ready by performing raycasting from above downward to detect map geometry and ensures physics interactions are properly initialized before gameplay begins. Performs checks every frame until valid map geometry is detected, with a timeout after 180 frames to prevent infinite checking. Excludes Capsule shapes (likely characters/objects) and sensor colliders from the inspection.
    - **`Player.tsx`**: Advanced player component integrating RigidBodyPlayer with CharacterRenderer for comprehensive character management, physics interactions, and animation state management with collision detection capabilities.
    - **`PointingSystem.tsx`**: Core component for the point-and-click movement mechanics. Implements raycasting to convert screen clicks to world positions. Creates visual feedback when clicking on the ground (click effect).

  - **`scene/`**: Contains components related to scene setup.

    - **`GameScene.tsx`**: Comprehensive 3D scene setup component that orchestrates the entire rendering pipeline. Creates a full-screen container with `Canvas` component featuring shadow support and pointer lock functionality (activated on pointer down). Integrates `KeyboardControls` with custom keyboard mapping, configures the physics simulation using the `Physics` component from `@react-three/rapier`, integrates `PointToMoveController`, `FollowLight`, and `PointingSystem` within the physics context. Monitors map physics system readiness state (`isMapPhysicsReady`) to control physics simulation pause/resume and displays loading screen when not ready. Uses `MapPhysicsReadyChecker` component to verify map physics system initialization and loads the `Experience` component with `Suspense` fallback to handle async loading of 3D assets.
    - **`PreloadScene.tsx`**: Manages asset preloading before the game starts. Loads all assets defined in assets.json (models, textures, etc.) and displays a loading progress bar. Ensures all assets are loaded before the game begins.

  - **`ui/`**: Contains UI components for the game interface.
    - **`LoadingScreen.tsx`**: Loading screen component displayed during game loading.

### Key Libraries & Components from External Sources

- **`vibe-starter-3d`**: A library providing foundational 3D game components and utilities.
  - **`PointToMoveController`**: Wraps the player character and manages point-to-move navigation by implementing a character controller with physics. It handles character movement, rotation, and camera following.
  - **`CharacterRenderer`**: Renders 3D character models with animations from glTF/GLB files. Manages animation states and transitions.
  - **`useControllerState`**: A React hook that provides control state management for the character, including:
    - `setEnableInput`: Function to enable/disable player input controls
    - `setMoveToPoint`: Function to set the destination point for character movement
    - `isPointMoving`: Function that returns whether the character is currently moving toward a point
    - `rigidBody`: Reference to the physics body for the character

### Point-to-Move System Implementation

The point-to-move system is implemented through a combination of components:

1. **Click Detection**: `PointingSystem` component uses raycasting to convert mouse clicks to 3D world positions, providing visual feedback at the clicked location.

2. **Movement Control**: `PointToMoveController` from the vibe-starter-3d library handles the physics-based movement of the character toward the destination point with orthographic camera integration.

3. **State Management**: `useControllerState` hook provides shared state between components, allowing the pointing system to set movement targets that the controller can read. Additionally, `playerStore` manages physics body references for multiplayer support.

4. **Animation Management**: `Player` component with `RigidBodyPlayer` integration determines appropriate animations based on movement state, using the `isPointMoving()` function to detect when the character should be in a movement animation state, with full collision detection capabilities.

5. **Asset Management**: `PreloadScene` component ensures all 3D models, textures, and other assets are preloaded before gameplay begins, providing a smooth user experience with a visual loading indicator.
