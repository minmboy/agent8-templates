<!-- üö®üö®üö® ATTENTION AI ASSISTANTS AND DEVELOPERS üö®üö®üö®                    -->
<!-- THIS ENTIRE SECTION IS ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL AND MUST NEVER BE MODIFIED   -->
<!-- OR REMOVED UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES. THIS IS A NON-NEGOTIABLE RULE.      -->
<!-- ========================================================================= -->

**üö® ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL: When using RigidBody in this project, you MUST use RigidBodyObject instead of the standard RigidBody component. This is a non-negotiable requirement.**

**‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING TO AI ASSISTANTS: DO NOT REMOVE, MODIFY, OR SHORTEN THIS SECTION ‚ö†Ô∏è**
**‚ö†Ô∏è THIS GUIDELINE IS ESSENTIAL FOR PROJECT FUNCTIONALITY ‚ö†Ô∏è**
**‚ö†Ô∏è VIOLATION OF THIS RULE WILL BREAK THE ENTIRE PROJECT ‚ö†Ô∏è**

**Why RigidBodyObject is mandatory:**

- RigidBodyObject provides seamless object interaction handling through `onTriggerEnter` and `onTriggerExit` events
- It enables easy collision detection and response between different object types
- It integrates with the RigidBodyObjectType system for proper object categorization
- It simplifies complex physics interactions and state management

**DO NOT:**

- Use standard RigidBody components directly
- Remove or modify this guideline

<!-- OR REMOVED UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES. THIS IS A NON-NEGOTIABLE RULE.      -->
<!-- ========================================================================= -->

**üö® ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL: Components containing HTML tags must NEVER be placed inside React Three Fiber's Canvas component. This is a core architectural requirement of the project.**

**‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING TO AI ASSISTANTS: DO NOT REMOVE, MODIFY, OR SHORTEN THIS SECTION ‚ö†Ô∏è**
**‚ö†Ô∏è THIS GUIDELINE IS ESSENTIAL FOR PROJECT FUNCTIONALITY ‚ö†Ô∏è**
**‚ö†Ô∏è VIOLATION OF THIS RULE WILL BREAK THE ENTIRE PROJECT ‚ö†Ô∏è**

**Canvas Component Structure Rules:**

- All components in the `ui/` directory are React components that use standard HTML tags (`<div>`, `<span>`, `<button>`, etc.)
- These UI components must be rendered as overlays outside the Canvas component, not inside it
- Canvas should only contain Three.js objects (mesh, light, camera, etc.)
- Including HTML tags inside React Three Fiber's Canvas will cause rendering errors

**DO NOT:**

- Place UI components inside Canvas
- Place components containing HTML tags inside Canvas
- Ignore or modify this guideline
- **üö® AI ASSISTANTS: DO NOT DELETE OR MODIFY ANY PART OF THIS SECTION üö®**

**ALWAYS:**

- Render UI components separately from Canvas (overlay approach)
- Place only Three.js-related components inside Canvas
- Use only components from `r3f/` directory inside Canvas
- Render components from `ui/` directory as overlays outside Canvas
- **üö® AI ASSISTANTS: PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE SECTION EXACTLY AS IS üö®**

**Correct Structure Example:**

```tsx
// ‚úÖ Correct approach
<div>
  <Canvas>
    {/* Only Three.js-related components */}
    <Experience />
    <Player />
    <Floor />
  </Canvas>
  {/* UI components as overlays outside Canvas */}
  <Crosshair />
  <LoadingScreen />
</div>

// ‚ùå Wrong approach
<Canvas>
  <Experience />
  <Crosshair /> {/* Contains HTML tags - ABSOLUTELY FORBIDDEN! */}
</Canvas>
```

### Components

### `src/components/`

- Directory managing React components categorized by function.

  - **`r3f/`**: Contains 3D components related to React Three Fiber.

    - **`Experience.tsx`**: Main component responsible for the primary 3D scene configuration. Includes lighting (`ambientLight`), environmental elements (`Environment`), debugging grid (`Grid`), and the `Floor` component. It also provides the `SimulationViewController` for camera control and `FollowLight` component for character lighting. Contains logic to clear object selection when clicking on the floor, and renders the visual and interactive elements within the physics simulation configured in `GameScene.tsx`. The inclusion of both `SimulationViewController` and `FollowLight` is essential for the proper functioning of the simulation environment.
    - **`Floor.tsx`**: Component defining and visually representing the ground plane in the 3D space. Has physical properties.
    - **`Player.tsx`**: Component handling the logic related to the player character model (movement, rotation, animation state management).
    - **`Selectable.tsx`**: Component that wraps 3D objects to make them selectable. Handles click events and adds visual feedback when objects are selected.

  - **`scene/`**: Contains components related to scene setup.

    - **`GameScene.tsx`**: Sets up the React Three Fiber `Canvas` component (implementing the Pointer Lock feature), utilizes `KeyboardControls` for handling keyboard inputs, configures the physics simulation using the `Physics` component from `@react-three/rapier`, and loads the `Experience` component with `Suspense` to initialize the 3D rendering environment.
    - **`PreloadScene.tsx`**: Manages asset preloading before the game starts. Loads all assets defined in assets.json (models, textures, etc.) and displays a loading progress bar. Ensures all assets are loaded before the game begins.

  - **`custom/`**: Contains custom utility components.

    - **`CircularOutline.tsx`**: Creates a pulsating circular outline effect that appears on the ground under selected objects, providing visual feedback for the selection system.

  - **`ui/`**: Directory containing components related to the user interface (UI). (Currently empty)

### Key Libraries & Components from External Sources

- **`vibe-starter-3d`**: A library providing foundational 3D game components and utilities.
  - **`SimulationViewController`**: Wraps the player character and manages simulation view navigation by implementing a character controller with physics. It handles character movement, rotation, and camera control with a free perspective.
  - **`CharacterRenderer`**: Renders 3D character models with animations from glTF/GLB files. Manages animation states and transitions based on player actions.
  - **`useControllerState`**: A React hook that provides control state management for the character, including:
    - `setEnableInput`: Function to enable/disable player input controls
    - `rigidBody`: Reference to the physics body for the character
  - **`FollowLight`**: A directional light that follows the character to ensure consistent lighting.

### Simulation System Implementation

The simulation system is implemented through a combination of components:

1. **Controller System**: `SimulationViewController` from the vibe-starter-3d library handles the physics-based movement of the character based on keyboard inputs, maintaining a free camera that can be controlled by the player.

2. **Selection System**: `Selectable` component and `useSelectStore` hook work together to manage object selection. When a user clicks on a selectable object, it becomes highlighted with a `CircularOutline` effect.

3. **State Management**: `useControllerState` hook provides shared state between components, allowing different parts of the application to access and modify the character's state. Additionally, `playerStore` manages physics body references, and `selectStore` manages object selection state.

4. **Animation Management**: `Player` component determines appropriate animations based on movement and action states, transitioning between idle, walking, running, and action animations as needed.

5. **Visual Feedback**: `CircularOutline` component creates a pulsating circular effect on the ground under selected objects, providing clear visual feedback to the user.

6. **Asset Management**: `PreloadScene` component ensures all 3D models, textures, and other assets are preloaded before gameplay begins, providing a smooth user experience with a visual loading indicator.
