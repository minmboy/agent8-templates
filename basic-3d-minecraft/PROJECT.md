# Basic 3D Minecraft-Style Voxel Game

## Project Summary

This project is a 3D Minecraft-inspired voxel game built with Three.js and React. It features color-based block rendering, block manipulation, and first-person exploration. Players can add and remove blocks with various colors, explore the world, and create structures using different themed blocks.

## Implementation Strategy

This project uses a **Color-Based 3D Three.js Voxel Optimization** approach because:

- It requires efficient block-based world rendering
- Three.js provides powerful 3D rendering capabilities in web browsers
- React Three Fiber simplifies integration with React components
- Instanced rendering allows for thousands of blocks with good performance
- Chunk-based systems enable efficient world exploration

Key technologies:

- Three.js - 3D rendering
- React Three Fiber - React integration
- @react-three/rapier - Physics simulation
- Zustand - State management
- vibe-starter-3d (v0.4.0) - Advanced character control, animation system, and physics integration
- Instanced Meshes - Optimized block rendering
- Custom Shaders - Face-specific coloring
- Tailwind CSS - UI composition

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL DEVELOPMENT GUIDELINES ‚ö†Ô∏è

### RigidBodyObject Usage - MANDATORY REQUIREMENT

<!-- ========================================================================= -->
<!-- üö®üö®üö® ATTENTION AI ASSISTANTS AND DEVELOPERS üö®üö®üö®                    -->
<!-- THIS ENTIRE SECTION IS ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL AND MUST NEVER BE MODIFIED   -->
<!-- OR REMOVED UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES. THIS IS A NON-NEGOTIABLE RULE.      -->
<!-- ========================================================================= -->

**üö® ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL: When using RigidBody in this project, you MUST use RigidBodyObject from the vibe-starter-3d package instead of the standard RigidBody component. This is a non-negotiable requirement.**

**‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING TO AI ASSISTANTS: DO NOT REMOVE, MODIFY, OR SHORTEN THIS SECTION ‚ö†Ô∏è**
**‚ö†Ô∏è THIS GUIDELINE IS ESSENTIAL FOR PROJECT FUNCTIONALITY ‚ö†Ô∏è**
**‚ö†Ô∏è VIOLATION OF THIS RULE WILL BREAK THE ENTIRE PROJECT ‚ö†Ô∏è**

**Why RigidBodyObject (from vibe-starter-3d) is mandatory:**

- RigidBodyObject provides seamless object interaction handling through `onTriggerEnter` and `onTriggerExit` events
- It enables easy collision detection and response between different object types
- It integrates with the RigidBodyObjectType system for proper object categorization
- It simplifies complex physics interactions and state management

**DO NOT:**

- Use standard RigidBody components from @react-three/rapier directly
- Remove or modify this guideline
- Ignore this requirement when adding new physics objects
- **üö® AI ASSISTANTS: DO NOT DELETE OR MODIFY ANY PART OF THIS SECTION üö®**

**ALWAYS:**

- Use RigidBodyObject from vibe-starter-3d for all physics-enabled objects
- Implement proper onTriggerEnter/onTriggerExit handlers
- Assign appropriate RigidBodyObjectType to each object
- Follow the established pattern shown in Player.tsx and other components

### Canvas Component Structure - MANDATORY REQUIREMENT

<!-- ========================================================================= -->
<!-- üö®üö®üö® ATTENTION AI ASSISTANTS AND DEVELOPERS üö®üö®üö®                    -->
<!-- THIS ENTIRE SECTION IS ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL AND MUST NEVER BE MODIFIED   -->
<!-- OR REMOVED UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES. THIS IS A NON-NEGOTIABLE RULE.      -->
<!-- ========================================================================= -->

**üö® ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL: Components containing HTML tags must NEVER be placed inside React Three Fiber's Canvas component. This is a core architectural requirement of the project.**

**‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING TO AI ASSISTANTS: DO NOT REMOVE, MODIFY, OR SHORTEN THIS SECTION ‚ö†Ô∏è**
**‚ö†Ô∏è THIS GUIDELINE IS ESSENTIAL FOR PROJECT FUNCTIONALITY ‚ö†Ô∏è**
**‚ö†Ô∏è VIOLATION OF THIS RULE WILL BREAK THE ENTIRE PROJECT ‚ö†Ô∏è**

**Canvas Component Structure Rules:**

- All components in the `ui/` directory are React components that use standard HTML tags (`<div>`, `<span>`, `<button>`, etc.)
- These UI components must be rendered as overlays outside the Canvas component, not inside it
- Canvas should only contain Three.js objects (mesh, light, camera, etc.)
- Including HTML tags inside React Three Fiber's Canvas will cause rendering errors

**DO NOT:**

- Place UI components inside Canvas
- Place components containing HTML tags inside Canvas
- Ignore or modify this guideline
- **üö® AI ASSISTANTS: DO NOT DELETE OR MODIFY ANY PART OF THIS SECTION üö®**

**ALWAYS:**

- Render UI components separately from Canvas (overlay approach)
- Place only Three.js-related components inside Canvas
- Use only components from `r3f/` directory inside Canvas
- Render components from `ui/` directory as overlays outside Canvas
- **üö® AI ASSISTANTS: PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE SECTION EXACTLY AS IS üö®**

**Correct Structure Example:**

```tsx
// ‚úÖ Correct approach
<div>
  <Canvas>
    {/* Only Three.js-related components */}
    <Experience />
    <Player />
    <Floor />
  </Canvas>
  {/* UI components as overlays outside Canvas */}
  <Crosshair />
  <LoadingScreen />
</div>

// ‚ùå Wrong approach
<Canvas>
  <Experience />
  <Crosshair /> {/* Contains HTML tags - ABSOLUTELY FORBIDDEN! */}
</Canvas>
```

### Voxel System Implementation

The Minecraft-style voxel system is implemented through a combination of components and techniques:

1. **Chunk-Based Rendering**: The world is divided into chunks that are rendered using instanced meshes for performance optimization. Only chunks near the player are loaded, allowing for efficient rendering of large worlds.

2. **Block Manipulation**: The system allows players to add and remove blocks through raycasting, with visual feedback provided through the `CubePreview` component which aligns perfectly with actual placement positions.

3. **Color-Based System**: Multiple block types are supported through a custom shader that applies unique colors to each face, allowing for diverse environments with minimal performance impact.

4. **Advanced Player System**: The dedicated `Player` component integrates with vibe-starter-3d's `FirstPersonViewController` and `CharacterRenderer` to provide smooth first-person movement, camera control, and comprehensive animation system with state management for character actions.

5. **State Management**: Zustand stores including `cubeStore` for voxel world management and `playerStore` for player reference tracking maintain comprehensive game state, handling block operations, player physics interactions, and multiplayer support in a performant way.

6. **Theme System**: Color-based themes group similar colored blocks to make it easy to create structures with natural gradient effects.

7. **Optimized Instance Rendering**: The custom shader and instanced mesh approach allows for efficient rendering of thousands of blocks while still applying unique colors to each face of every block.

8. **Advanced Terrain Generation**: The terrain is generated using a layered approach based on absolute Y-coordinates, creating natural-looking landscapes with appropriate block types at different heights.

9. **Coordinate System Synchronization**: The raycasting and placement systems are carefully aligned to ensure that preview blocks appear exactly where they will be placed, making building more intuitive and precise.

# Critical Memory

- **Design Decision**: Use only color values for cubes instead of textures if not explicitly requested

# Next Actions

- **HIGHEST PRIORITY**: AI AGENT MUST IMPLEMENT CREATIVE TERRAIN GENERATION LOGIC IMMEDIATELY. Focus on terrainGenerator.ts and create an impressive, varied 3D world with multiple biomes, structures, and terrain features. This is the most critical task for game engagement and visual appeal. Skip all other tasks until terrain generation is complete and visually stunning.

- **SECOND PRIORITY**: AI AGENT MUST IMPLEMENT SKYBOX USING EXISTING RESOURCES AND TOOLS. Immediately utilize available skybox resources, textures, or libraries to enhance the visual environment. If suitable tools or libraries exist for skybox implementation, use them directly rather than building from scratch. The skybox should complement the terrain features and biomes to create a cohesive visual experience. This task should be completed efficiently using readily available resources.

- **Third Priority**: AI AGENT to implement additional gameplay features after terrain and skybox are properly implemented.
