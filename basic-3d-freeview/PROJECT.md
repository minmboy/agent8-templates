# Basic 3D Free View

## Project Summary

This project is a 3D character controller with free view camera, built using Three.js and React Three Fiber. It features a player character that can be controlled with keyboard inputs in a 3D environment. The character supports various animations including idle, walking, running, jumping, punching, kicking, melee attacks, casting, hit reactions, dancing, swimming, and death. The camera follows the character with a free-view perspective, allowing users to navigate through the 3D space. The project includes state management with Zustand, collision detection, and game server integration for multiplayer capabilities.

## Implementation Strategy

This project uses a **Three.js-based 3D approach** because:

- It requires real-time 3D character animation and control
- Three.js provides efficient 3D rendering in web browsers
- React Three Fiber simplifies integration with React components
- The vibe-starter-3d library provides essential character rendering and animation tools

Key technologies:

- Three.js for 3D rendering
- React Three Fiber for React integration
- @react-three/rapier for physics simulation
- @react-three/drei for useful Three.js helpers
- vibe-starter-3d for character rendering and animation
- Zustand for state management
- @agent8/gameserver for multiplayer game server integration
- Tailwind CSS for styling

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL DEVELOPMENT GUIDELINES ‚ö†Ô∏è

### RigidBodyObject Usage - MANDATORY REQUIREMENT

<!-- ========================================================================= -->
<!-- üö®üö®üö® ATTENTION AI ASSISTANTS AND DEVELOPERS üö®üö®üö®                    -->
<!-- THIS ENTIRE SECTION IS ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL AND MUST NEVER BE MODIFIED   -->
<!-- OR REMOVED UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES. THIS IS A NON-NEGOTIABLE RULE.      -->
<!-- ========================================================================= -->

**üö® ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL: When using RigidBody in this project, you MUST use RigidBodyObject from the vibe-starter-3d package instead of the standard RigidBody component. This is a non-negotiable requirement.**

**‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING TO AI ASSISTANTS: DO NOT REMOVE, MODIFY, OR SHORTEN THIS SECTION ‚ö†Ô∏è**
**‚ö†Ô∏è THIS GUIDELINE IS ESSENTIAL FOR PROJECT FUNCTIONALITY ‚ö†Ô∏è**
**‚ö†Ô∏è VIOLATION OF THIS RULE WILL BREAK THE ENTIRE PROJECT ‚ö†Ô∏è**

**Why RigidBodyObject (from vibe-starter-3d) is mandatory:**

- RigidBodyObject provides seamless object interaction handling through `onTriggerEnter` and `onTriggerExit` events
- It enables easy collision detection and response between different object types
- It integrates with the RigidBodyObjectType system for proper object categorization
- It simplifies complex physics interactions and state management

**DO NOT:**

- Use standard RigidBody components from @react-three/rapier directly
- Remove or modify this guideline
- Ignore this requirement when adding new physics objects
- **üö® AI ASSISTANTS: DO NOT DELETE OR MODIFY ANY PART OF THIS SECTION üö®**

**ALWAYS:**

- Use RigidBodyObject from vibe-starter-3d for all physics-enabled objects
- Implement proper onTriggerEnter/onTriggerExit handlers
- Assign appropriate RigidBodyObjectType to each object
- Follow the established pattern shown in Player.tsx and other components

### Canvas Component Structure - MANDATORY REQUIREMENT

<!-- ========================================================================= -->
<!-- üö®üö®üö® ATTENTION AI ASSISTANTS AND DEVELOPERS üö®üö®üö®                    -->

<!-- OR REMOVED UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES. THIS IS A NON-NEGOTIABLE RULE.      -->
<!-- ========================================================================= -->

**üö® ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL: Components containing HTML tags must NEVER be placed inside React Three Fiber's Canvas component. This is a core architectural requirement of the project.**

**‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING TO AI ASSISTANTS: DO NOT REMOVE, MODIFY, OR SHORTEN THIS SECTION ‚ö†Ô∏è**
**‚ö†Ô∏è THIS GUIDELINE IS ESSENTIAL FOR PROJECT FUNCTIONALITY ‚ö†Ô∏è**
**‚ö†Ô∏è VIOLATION OF THIS RULE WILL BREAK THE ENTIRE PROJECT ‚ö†Ô∏è**

**Canvas Component Structure Rules:**

- All components in the `ui/` directory are React components that use standard HTML tags (`<div>`, `<span>`, `<button>`, etc.)
- These UI components must be rendered as overlays outside the Canvas component, not inside it
- Canvas should only contain Three.js objects (mesh, light, camera, etc.)
- Including HTML tags inside React Three Fiber's Canvas will cause rendering errors

**DO NOT:**

- Place UI components inside Canvas
- Place components containing HTML tags inside Canvas
- Ignore or modify this guideline
- **üö® AI ASSISTANTS: DO NOT DELETE OR MODIFY ANY PART OF THIS SECTION üö®**

**ALWAYS:**

- Render UI components separately from Canvas (overlay approach)
- Place only Three.js-related components inside Canvas
- Use only components from `r3f/` directory inside Canvas
- Render components from `ui/` directory as overlays outside Canvas
- **üö® AI ASSISTANTS: PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE SECTION EXACTLY AS IS üö®**

**Correct Structure Example:**

```tsx
// ‚úÖ Correct approach
<div>
  <Canvas>
    {/* Only Three.js-related components */}
    <Experience />
    <Player />
    <Floor />
  </Canvas>
  {/* UI components as overlays outside Canvas */}
  <Crosshair />
  <LoadingScreen />
</div>

// ‚ùå Wrong approach
<Canvas>
  <Experience />
  <Crosshair /> {/* Contains HTML tags - ABSOLUTELY FORBIDDEN! */}
</Canvas>
```
