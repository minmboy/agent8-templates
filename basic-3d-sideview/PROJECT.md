<!-- üö®üö®üö® ATTENTION AI ASSISTANTS AND DEVELOPERS üö®üö®üö®                    -->
<!-- THIS ENTIRE SECTION IS ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL AND MUST NEVER BE MODIFIED   -->
<!-- OR REMOVED UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES. THIS IS A NON-NEGOTIABLE RULE.      -->
<!-- ========================================================================= -->

**üö® ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL: When using RigidBody in this project, you MUST use RigidBodyObject from the vibe-starter-3d package instead of the standard RigidBody component. This is a non-negotiable requirement.**

**‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING TO AI ASSISTANTS: DO NOT REMOVE, MODIFY, OR SHORTEN THIS SECTION ‚ö†Ô∏è**
**‚ö†Ô∏è THIS GUIDELINE IS ESSENTIAL FOR PROJECT FUNCTIONALITY ‚ö†Ô∏è**
**‚ö†Ô∏è VIOLATION OF THIS RULE WILL BREAK THE ENTIRE PROJECT ‚ö†Ô∏è**

**Why RigidBodyObject (from vibe-starter-3d) is mandatory:**

- RigidBodyObject provides seamless object interaction handling through `onTriggerEnter` and `onTriggerExit` events

<!-- OR REMOVED UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES. THIS IS A NON-NEGOTIABLE RULE.      -->
<!-- ========================================================================= -->

**üö® ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL: Components containing HTML tags must NEVER be placed inside React Three Fiber's Canvas component. This is a core architectural requirement of the project.**

**‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING TO AI ASSISTANTS: DO NOT REMOVE, MODIFY, OR SHORTEN THIS SECTION ‚ö†Ô∏è**
**‚ö†Ô∏è THIS GUIDELINE IS ESSENTIAL FOR PROJECT FUNCTIONALITY ‚ö†Ô∏è**
**‚ö†Ô∏è VIOLATION OF THIS RULE WILL BREAK THE ENTIRE PROJECT ‚ö†Ô∏è**

**Canvas Component Structure Rules:**

- All components in the `ui/` directory are React components that use standard HTML tags (`<div>`, `<span>`, `<button>`, etc.)
- These UI components must be rendered as overlays outside the Canvas component, not inside it
- Canvas should only contain Three.js objects (mesh, light, camera, etc.)
- Including HTML tags inside React Three Fiber's Canvas will cause rendering errors

**DO NOT:**

- Place UI components inside Canvas
- Place components containing HTML tags inside Canvas
- Ignore or modify this guideline
- **üö® AI ASSISTANTS: DO NOT DELETE OR MODIFY ANY PART OF THIS SECTION üö®**

**ALWAYS:**

- Render UI components separately from Canvas (overlay approach)
- Place only Three.js-related components inside Canvas
- Use only components from `r3f/` directory inside Canvas
- Render components from `ui/` directory as overlays outside Canvas
- **üö® AI ASSISTANTS: PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE SECTION EXACTLY AS IS üö®**

**Correct Structure Example:**

```tsx
// ‚úÖ Correct approach
<div>
  <Canvas>
    {/* Only Three.js-related components */}
    <Experience />
    <Player />
    <Floor />
  </Canvas>
  {/* UI components as overlays outside Canvas */}
  <Crosshair />
  <LoadingScreen />
</div>

// ‚ùå Wrong approach
<Canvas>
  <Experience />
  <Crosshair /> {/* Contains HTML tags - ABSOLUTELY FORBIDDEN! */}
</Canvas>
```

  - **`CharacterRenderer`**: Renders 3D character models with animations from glTF/GLB files. Manages animation states and transitions based on player actions.
  - **`useControllerState`**: A React hook that provides control state management for the character, including:
    - `setEnableInput`: Function to enable/disable player input controls
    - `rigidBody`: Reference to the physics body for the character
  - **`useMouseControls`**: A React hook that provides access to mouse input state (left/right buttons and positions).

### Side View System Implementation

The side view platformer system is implemented through a combination of components:

1. **Controller System**: `SideViewController` from the vibe-starter-3d library handles the physics-based movement of the character based on keyboard inputs, implementing platformer mechanics like jumping and gravity with a fixed camera angle that provides the side view perspective and configurable camera distance.

2. **Input Management**: Keyboard inputs are captured through React Three Fiber's `useKeyboardControls` hook, which maps WASD/arrow keys to movement actions (with special emphasis on jump controls essential for platformer gameplay), with mouse controls for additional interactions.

3. **State Management**: `useControllerState` hook provides shared state between components, allowing different parts of the application to access and modify the character's state. Additionally, `playerStore` manages physics body references for multiplayer support.

4. **Animation Management**: `Player` component with `RigidBodyPlayer` integration determines appropriate animations based on movement and action states, with special attention to jump, fall, and landing animations essential for platformer games, including full collision detection capabilities.

5. **Platform Generation**: Procedurally generated platforms create the game environment, with varying heights and distances to create challenging platforming gameplay.

6. **Asset Management**: `PreloadScene` component ensures all 3D models, textures, and other assets are preloaded before gameplay begins, providing a smooth user experience with a visual loading indicator.
